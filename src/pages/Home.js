            <p>
              I’ll speak if you need my tongue
              Work if you need my hands,
              Think if you need my mind
              And move if you need my legs
              But should you ever need my heart,
              It’s already sealed thine.
              I’ve given you everything
              What do you make of me?.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Backsliding</h3>
            <p>
              To backslide, to tread thrice a path you could
              Have trodden but once; that’s a tragedy to avoid,
              Resolve to tread these paths of thorns and thistles only but once
              And thereafter forever tread the paths of gold with ease.
            </p>

            <h3>3. The Focal Point</h3>
            <p>
              As the bride eyes not at her garment,
              but her groom’s face;
              So gaze not at glory but at the goal.
              Focus not on the crown but on the price.
              Be fully engaged with the present.
              Not consumed with the future nor past
            </p>

            <h3>4. The Sacredness of Life</h3>
            <p>
              There are many chances but all within the confines of this one life
              You obliterate this one life and you mess everything. Everything!
              All the possibilities that could have turned into actualities had you acted otherwise
              That’s the sacredness of life and the immense power you exercise over it.
            </p>

            <h3>5. The Fragility of Life</h3>
            <p>
              The apple does not survive a blow
              One small bruise and we die
              Beautiful but delicate, that’s who we are.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Protection</h3>
            <p>
              You can’t protect people from everything.
              The responsibility of protecting someone you love
              Is to protect them from yourself and themselves.
              Beyond that are external forces
              Not even you can protect yourself
              Nor can you live without an encounter.
              When it’s impossible to protect someone
              Teach them how to weather the storm.
              With a good know-how anyone can handle anything.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Current Regime</h3>
            <p>
              The warriors of the old were honored for protecting the sheep against wolves.
              The warriors of today are paid to prevent the sheep from becoming wolves.
              The goal is to have an empire of the conquered and convinced.
              The non-conformed are labeled as threats to state progress- outlaws.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Testimony</h3>
            <p>
              I was young but now am old, yet have never seen the humble,
              The honest and the hardworking eventually brought to shame.
              The world may be a cruel place but it’s still a generous rewarder
              Of consistent virtue, honest nobility, and humble integrity.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Modern Slavery</h3>
            <p>
              Today’s slaves aren’t sold by force,
              They compete to be bought
              Cheaply by the highest bidder.
              Perhaps we all slaves, until freed.
            </p>

            <h3>10. The Real Problem</h3>
            <p>
              We are free men – free to choose.
              What we lack is not the liberty of choice but wisdom to choice
              To discern right and best amongst options and directions
              And for the most part, it’s not that wisdom is lacking,
              It’s just that it is blurred under a cloud of negligence, ignorance, or arrogance.
              If you can’t find it with your intellect, why not try seeking it on your knees?
              Where human intellect has failed, the knee has always conquered.
              He is a fool who gives up without exhausted all options.
            </p>

            <h3>11. The Blueprint</h3>
            <p>
              Seek abundance in all things that are noble
              But when it comes to God, wife and life, seek only but one;
              One holy God, one good wife, and one life that’s true.
              Divided attention in these renders life’s effort fruitless.
            </p>

            <h3>12. The Real King</h3>
            <p>
              It doesn’t matter who sits on the throne,
              Whoever writes the syllabus and gives wings
              To the prevailing narratives runs the affairs.
            </p>

            <h3>13. Compromise</h3>
            <p>
              Naturally, people respect boundaries
              Until they are comprised from within.
              From thence, they come in as spoilers
              Looting the reserve till it’s left for the vultures.
            </p>

            <h3>14. Key Ingredient</h3>
            <p>
              Origin, Identity, and Purpose are key in life.
              He who has lost them has nothing left to lose.
              But everything, either to regain or give away.15. Human Life
              There is no self-made man.
              No creature is a creator of itself.
              Everyman is a product of others,
              Their sacrifice, their influence, and support.
              Beginning from his or her parents.
            </p>

            <h3>16. The Big Question</h3>
            <p>
              The question of religion isn’t really a question
              Of your knowledge of God or His knowledge of you
              Nor it is a question of His reliability to you.
              God is reliable, He knows all, and anyone can know Him.
              The question of religion is a question of God’s certainty
              To depend on you and acknowledge you as His own.
              Does He acknowledge you as His?
              When it counts, can He depend on you?
            </p>

            <h3>17. The Irony in mankind</h3>
            <p>
              The world languishes for the want of truth
              But truth comes with a weight weak shoulders can’t bear.
              Tell men the truth and they will exclude you.
              Feed them a lie long enough
              And they themselves will defend it against the truth.
            </p>

            <h3>18. Caution</h3>
            <p>
              Beware of people who publish themselves as victims,
              More often they are the trouble makers
              Exploiting the sympathy of shallow hearts
              Real victims are never too bold.
            </p>

            <h3>19. Producers vs Consumers</h3>
            <p>
              God is a creator so should be His children.
              The idea of consumption without production is ungodly.
              He provides opportunities, abilities, and materials,
              What you make of it depends on the thoroughness
              With which you harness your creativity
              And the extent to which you make the best use
              Of time, treasure, talents, and temple; your resources.
              In the end, you are what you nourished, a consumer or a producer.
            </p>

            <h3>20. Secret of contentment</h3>
            <p>
              There is never enough, not money, not resources,
              Not resources. Not beauty nor muscles or problems.
              There will be more money, less time, younger ladies,
              Better men, more problems, less solutions and more promises.
              Nothing is never enough except with self-discipine.
            </p>

            <h3>21. The Real Threat</h3>
            <p>
              Be afraid of professional Christianity
              The critical Judas, the persecuting SaulEver working like the Devil for the Lord
              Trumpeting the evil in angels.
              But never commends the good in men.
              Preachers of the living word
              But never lives the word nor leave the world.
              Betrays the Lord and seal it with a kiss.
              Crucifies the man for being a reprove to hypocrisy.
              Whips the lady for being extravagant in Thanksgiving.
              And blocks the thirsty from the well and bread of life.
              Better suffer thy plights in the hands of the Lord
              In Him there is a lifting up, a comeback
              Than have your case left to the professional Christian
              Oh poor soul, you’re going down, tripped of honor.
            </p>

            <h3>22. The Real Deal</h3>
            <p>
              Our lives is deemed significant and relevant
              Not on the basis of what we carry away
              Eventually we carries nothing.
              But on what we leave behind.
              For this reason, death is feared
              Not for what it carries away
              But for it leaves behind, the void, the stain.
            </p>

            <h3>23. Human Limitedness</h3>
            <p>
              The mark of intelligence is not in knowing what you can do
              But in knowing what you can’t do. No one is God.
              You can only carry your own weight
              And few extra load for the few you can.
              But you can’t carry the weight of everyone everywhere,
              It’s either a romantic lie or insidious pretense.
              Many hold claim responsibilities and burdens
              That not even God would put on their shoulders.
              Be fit and keep light, burdens slows the soul.
            </p>

            <h3>24. Solemn Duty</h3>
            <p>
              It’s the duty of each generation is to be better than the previous,
              And to inspire, train, and equip a successive generation better than them.
              Posterity is the only efficient medium of sustaining anything
              Thus we’re ever one generation away from extinction or elevation.

            <h2>Sayings</h2>
            1. Simple is never complicated. But it’s the hardest to find
            2. Life is lived in the present for the future but best understood from the past.
            The beauty of it is to look back and appreciate how you got here.
            1. Everyone ought to carry his own weight and help others if he can.
            A child is a child but an incompetent man is a beggar, a burden.
            2. It’s not the rate of unemployment that worries me
            But the number that’s is comfortably underemployed.

            3. Gain all things and in all your gaining
            Accumulate the blessings and favors of both men and God.

            5. Resignation is not revolt. If you don’t like it
            Change it from within and without.
            6. Generosity isn’t in the giving of the extra you have, that’s philanthropy.
            But in the sharing of the little with those who have none.
            7. Khotso ke nala; Peace is prosperity
            8. It’s always beautiful and desired until it’s experienced.
            9. The goal in life is progress, perfection is the end game.


            POEMS
            1. The Creed
            Though life be lived between birth and death’
            We hold it true that this world is not our home
            But our assignment to do and do it well.
            And we have no intentions of leaving it undone.
            But to fight like a Knight and soar for heights unseen
            Then when the bells toll, we’ll quit; but only like men
            With dignity, victory, and a legacy of integrity.
            Leaving behind a brighter world than we found.
            Our only regret is that we have only but one life,
            Only one life to live, for the glory of God and the service of others.
            Yet still, a better world is the gift we’ll give to our children
            When the time is come and the race is run.
            

            2. What Have We Done?
            Things that we prey on with straying feet
            And consume with intemperate appetite,
            Rob us of place and peace;
            Reducing us much lower than apes
            Initially, we pursued ideals and excellence;
            Every man clothed in his innocence,
            Was true to his creed and agreed to sense.
            Those were the old days before false intelligence
            Then came the sweeping floods of compromise
            Ushering a time when every man and nationTurned a betrayer of his flag and conscience.
            All was good until we compromised and experienced the otherwise.
            A lot has since changed, both within and without
            Former ideals and better ideas now sound extreme-
            Much like a threat. All that’s left are scars and masks
            A life of rot veneered with a thin sheet of glories-empty glories!
            The problem isn’t the vice nor the compromise
            But that in underestimating our ability to restore
            We settled for less and made peace with the mess
            Thus, we’ve been in hell far too long, we’ve made it home.
            O my! What have we done to ourselves?
            
            3. Bulls and Men
            The honor of bulls isn’t in their horns or skin-colors
            But in their strength, their frame and their diverse usefulness.
            To sire better calves, defend the fold against abuse,
            Be gentle with others, meet the demands for meat.
            And still with a fearless face, stand between whatever
            Plough and altar it may be, “Ready for either.”
            As it is in bulls so it is in men;
            Honored not for their gender nor complexion.
            But for their frame of mind, their strength of character,
            And their diverse expertise. To sire better generations.
            Be true Knights – calm but firm against tyranny and abuse,
            Gentle with others, and fit for other noble demands.
            Yet still, with manly courage, stand before whatever
            Plough or altar it may be, “Ready for either.”
            An accomplished man is a man of means; endowed with varieties.
            Broaden your field of interests and expertise, my lad!
            Specialization is for insects.
            One life and one thing is all you can be at a time
            But not all you should be thro’ all times
            You’re are the ruler of the universe.
            Heaven and earth, deserve the best of your gifts
            All provisions are at your disposal to fashion your life to its best existence
            But it’s yours to decide if you’ll ever stand in manly courage
            Before whatever plough or altar it may be “Ready for either.”
            
            
            4. The Art of Friendship
            Precious but rare is a good companion in a world competitive
            Many are befriended whose interest isn’t to build but outdo each other.
            Such falsehood like cheap stones, lies everywhere and anywhere.
            Loyalty and the desire for another best is the badge of real friendship.
            He who betrays a friend is unworthy of any man’s trust.
            True friendship isn’t about acting friendly but being a friend.
            The nature of friendship depends on how they materialize,
            What can be bought will be bought, such a friend is unworthy of any price
            But he who befriends a Jonathan gains a treasure beyond all price.
            Fellows like flies, are attracted by merry and parties
            But a friendship true is attracted to one’s personal qualities
            And any wise man knows only to build on what doesn’t sinks
            One’s deeds and ideas resemble that of his companions
            The measure of one’s virtue is that of his close associates
            A companion that thinks right, speaks right, and acts straight is above all comparisons.
          
            5. Readiness to Death and Life
            Death! Death with its strong claws makes no sound as it comes.
            With a precision of a sniper; mindless of height and tide it comes,
            Bearing no gifts, except graves and tears.
            And tho’ this dust be left cold and alone beneath the dark earth of silence,
            My soul triumphant shall rise beyond the skies of blue into the bliss of ease
            But till then, my gifts, my best, my all, I shall freely give
            For there’s no glory or gain in carrying such gold to the grave.
            But to plant them hither and watch them sprout into the promise of a better future.
            O death, my death! My reprieve for a moment
            Thou art my flight to the next assignment,
            I’t afraid of thee. For by thee, I shall transit into the glorious.
            To live is to die thus life hastes and wastes away every day
            But thou shall find me dusted and done, light and ready for the flight.
            And I shall leave no trace of regret when thou shall carry me away.
            
            6. The Other Portfolio
            Man, like God, always strives for excellence,
            His life is one, but lived in three phases,
            Each phase has a portfolio of its own.
            First, a student wanting an educated mind and experience,
            Then a professional playing his part in the theater of significance
            Lastly; perhaps till death, as spouse, building stability and molding generations
            But thro’ all these, man is ever a believer; many being Christians.
            The God of excellence demand no less from all at all times
            But man excels partially, excelling in all things except their Christian lives
            Hypocrisy and wanting is the label amongst most of the professed.
            Preaching the living word but never living the word nor leaving the world.
            Have the A’s but lacking in stars
            Building elegant homes but left without eternal mansions
            Making a mark in history but only for self not for souls
            If thou be a student in the school of Christ, work His will and walk His ways
            If thou be a soldier of the cross, keep the faith and fight the good fights
            If thou be a partner of grace; wedded to the course, humbly serve to bless others
            Many belong but are never involved; deeply rooted but ever fruitless.
            Such lip service with no heart experience; a profession of nothing but leaves
            Is an injury to one’s soul, an insult to God and injustice to others.
            My lad, excel in all things but be not lacking in a good Christian portfolio
            Lest all your life be of contempt to God and a stumbling block to others.
            
            7. The Power of One
            The change we desire and all we’ll ever know
            Is one man away - Just one man away.
            One man who knows the right way
            And wills to lead others in that way.
            Or one man who by ignorance or arrogance,
            Diverts the compass and leads all astray.
            There is no such a thing as a mass conception of ideas
            Every idea is birthed by one mind and sold to others.
            Thus at the foundation of every institution,
            Lies only but one brain.
            All change, through one man, for all men,
            That’s the immense power of one; lying in all men.
            But it’s all a matter of choice.
            Either to sit back and watch history evolve,
            Whine and burden the world with grievances as do others
            Or to task your mind and hand to give a revolutionary push
            In the making of a history you won’t blush.
            And help lift off burdens of the world.
            All the power for change, good and evil, lies in your hands
            The universe isn’t your creation
            But its condition is your making,
            So never ask to know who is in charge
            Nor who that one-man way is.
            It is you. Be the man.
            Show up and lead but lead not astray.
            
            8. The Source
            Goals, guts and guides, these are the determinants of one's success
            The magnitude of goals, the amplitude of gut, and the clarity of guide.
            But of these, God is supreme - the source.
            He elevates the goals, empowers the guts, and gives the absolute guide.
            Thus the longevity of one’s success is a function of his trueness to God
            To have God is to have ‘good, thus to get good, get God.
            But of what use is holding unto good when you can have the best.
            Or what use is God if you can’t get or make the best of him?
            There is no honor in suffering scarcity yet you limit the source.
            People are oft over-tasked where God is sidelined or limited.
            Hence God is often misrepresented and their faith despised.
            If you have to bow, bow low or go.
            There is no room for two on one throne.
            It’s either you or God. Choose!
            If it’s God, pay the utmost farthing, make Him Lord
            For God is at His best when He is the Lord.
            And if it’s you, go ahead but don’t hide behind God
            However, it’s better if you had God and made Him Lord
            Than to possess a form of godliness and lack the power thereof.
            Blessed is him whom the Lord God is his Lord.
            The best shall follow Him all the days of his life.

            9. The Centre Cannot Hold
            The weather is windy.
            The ground quakes
            The clouds rains
            And the air is toxic.
            All things are formless
            The course crumbled
            Friends are gone. Foes are nigh.
            Life is empty. The heart is heavy.
            How quickly things changed
            The centre hold no more.
            Strength is failing
            Things aren’t working.
            I too may stop. But not you.
            If you do, I‘m down.
            Gone without a star.
            A struggler I am, yielding I don’t.
            Tonight I fight but for power and for glory.
            Thy power and thy glory. Tonight I fight for thee.
            And if I go, I’ll go, but not without a crown.
            To lay down at your feet when breath is done.
            I can build an ark but
            I can’t anchor it on a mountaintop.
            I can chart the course n’ steer the wheel
            But I can’t call storms to peace and the seas to order.
            Human options are limited. But not yours.
            I got the net and strength to fish all day, all night.
            Left or right, only you know which side is best to cast the net.
            I got the skills to replenish the earth
            And fill it with glories – your glories
            But only if you’ll create my space in it.
            I’ll do man. You do God.
            Only then will life be effectual.
            Otherwise we going without a name.
            
            10. A Humble Soul
            We’ve been broken and low but now we’re whole.
            We know not how the breach was repaired
            Nor how the threads were woven into a tapestry
            More glorious than the former.
            But this we know, tis our hands that did the damage
            And His that cleaned the mess.
            Dust we are, a thing for the ground, to be trampled underfoot,
            Washed by tyranny or blown by the immediate.
            So if these lumps of clay ever rise above the ground,
            To soar the skies of blue and pitch its tent
            Beyond the stars on podiums of the great.
            It won’t be by virtue of our intellect nor might.
            But by the power and for the glory and on the account
            Of Him who works thro’ men for the blessing of others.
            Men are formed in the womb but fashioned in crucibles.
            It’s from the wilderness that we are moulded for our offices
            Then left to choose with what tools we will prune our story.
            And whether or not we’ll yield fruits
            By the tools of wisdom, love and character; we’ll work
            And at eve we’ll return, not empty handed.
            But with as much stars as possible.
            This is our policy. This our story.
            This is our creed. We are the Redeemed.
            
            11. Go all the way.
            What’s this rumbling I hear amongst you?
            A complaint arising from pole to pole.
            That things turned hard and life is unfair.
            Thus you succumbed to defeat and regress
            But if mountains were smooth
            Would anyone climb them?
            Or if the universe was all plain without peaks
            Wouldn’t the monotony be sickening?
            Dusk and dawn completes the day. Spring to autumn completes the year.
            So ups and lows completes life’s journey. Embrace them all.
            It’s vain to whine and burden the universe with grievances;
            Go all the way. Go all the way. Only then can you grow
            What’s this story told of you?
            A paradox incoherent with expectation
            That you long lost the vigour and now dwells in peace,
            A life of ease stagnating between false security and comfort.
            But if the pursuit was that cheap, as to discard and settle for less,
            Why then did you sacrifice and invest so much?
            Remember why you begun! Remember goal!
            Go all the way. Go all the way. Only then will you grow.
            Up or down, the road still winds onwards
            All that there is isn’t all that there can be.
            Fear is ally to defeat and good is enemy of best.
            Go all the way! Go all the way! Only then will you grow.
            
            12. Transitions
            Do the best you can,
            Soar heights like eagles
            Fight battles like Knights
            But only those you can win
            Without much scars or blows
            This the accepted philosophy
            Inherently safe but deeply unfulfilling.
            Thus we've lived, never truly fulfilled.
            Now with increased sagacity and tenacity,
            Take judicious risks, kiss the impossible,
            And outdo the best you've done.
            Seek not old footsteps to follow,
            But new trails to leave behind,
            Nothing can be more daring
            Yet that’s exactly what God demands of you.
            To do the best you can and ask for the impossible.
            Perhaps we'll fail, well, what's that?
            Failure like victory is insatiable,
            But you dare not cast our lot with defeat.
            Up or down, wind onwards.
            Proceed boldly into the continuous
            Wanting nothing but glories- Blessed glories.
            As for peace, save that for the last breath into eternity.
            This is the philosophy of Spartans and God.
            Daring but deeply fulfilling.
            Dare, only then we’ll life be truly fulfilling.

            13. What’s a Good Life?
            At first, I was young and poor,
            But full of health and strength.
            Wanting nothing but a good life –
            Immense wealth, power and fame;
            A life of bread and butter,
            Veges and farms are for peasants.
            That was the prescription then.
            Now I am aged, full of wealth
            But void of health and strength.
            A big title, everything as prescribed;
            A life of junks away from kith and kin.
            At no other time have I been so empty.
            Perhaps peace too belong to peasants.
            Old age beckons bearing tales of wisdom
            Wrapped in grey feathers. And it says:
            Life isn’t a vain pursuit all bent towards hell and death.
            If birds still sing despite the morning chills
            Then men too can know peace despite the thistles
            A good life you can have each rolling day
            Only find a purpose and give thy gifts away.
            Build around men and a loner never survives.
            Beyond self-gain, accumulate blessings and give away peace
            The goal is perfection, the path is progress.
            To be better and leave behind a brighter place.
            This is a good life and it weathers all storms.
          
            14. The Story Untold/ Blessings in Disguise.
            There is a story I once dreaded to tell,
            Which I now tell with regal ease.
            As is the custom of men,
            To take a train from place to place.
            I too, but without much thought
            Took a train which I thought
            Headed yonder to the land of promise.
            And yes it did, but to one contrary to my conscience.
            So as it wheeled away so did I peddle astray.
            In retrospect, ease is the worst jail one can ever be.
            Years have gone by since I jumped out,
            Jumped into the unknown, a wilderness,
            Beautiful to behold but dreary to experience.
            Yet with all its heartaches,
            It’s the best place I’ve ever been.
            Threshed and fitted from its crucibles for my noblest part.
            Rebuilt and recalibrated in its solitude.
            Someday I’ll tell the story in full;
            The story shared by every great mind-my story
            Formed in the womb but made in the wilderness.
            Either way, one truth remains.
            We are all athletes-ever running for a prize
            Perhaps away from ourselves and God
            Run, run and run fast but run right and keep light;
            Burdens injure the soul
            And wrong trajectories costs so dear.
            But as much as it is possible in you,
            Flee stagnation and reach for the crown
            A dwarfed life is offensive to God.
            Remember, you are what you can’t let go
            But if it cost your peace and noble place
            It’s not worth the price. What seems today as gold
            May in time become base metal.
            And what seems today like hell
            Will in future be a smile
            God deny you peace but give discernment and balance –
            A discerning mind and modest success.
            Only then will you know real peace.
            
            15. The Wisdom of Ages.
            Life is a quest, life is a hunt,
            A continuous search of things unattained.
            All men are hunters, all things are prey.
            If you aren’t hunting, you aren’t living.
            All are thirsty. Some thirsts are quenched
            Many are left questioning the answers.
            Either way, the world runs on scarcity and demand
            The human mind, being the main borne of contention -
            He who controls the mind runs the world.
            Man seeks for things vain or glorious,
            Church seeks for souls convinced and converted
            The state wants men conquered and submissive
            And the devil, the chief hunter, He wants to devour them all.
            Still, God sits as the chess master and rules all of them.
            All are hunters, but not all gather.
            But whether or not they gathers
            Death eventually gets what it wants.
            Carrying all of us away to rest.
            Just not the kind of exit we want.
            What matters is what you hunting
            And how worth is your hunt?
            
            16. Proverbs of Life
            [Incomplete]
            As spring turns to summer
            And flowering into fruit-bearing
            Likewise, childhood transit into adulthood
            As the bud opens to make evident the flower
            So does life transitions make all things evident
            In due time, time makes all things known.
            Life is a process of events. Be patient and present.
            Do not rush it, you can but you shouldn’t.
            To do so is to open the bud before it blossoms.
            The result is a tremble ruin and beauty unborn.
            Many lives are consumed on the altar of impulse and impatience
            Possibility doesn’t always equate to necessity.
            Be wise and discerning.
            Humans unlike animals, are creatures of instinct
            You ought to learn beyond what is inherit
            But learning takes time, exercise discipline and self-control
            The most important things are never the easiest
            Youth is the challenging but it’s a sowing time
            Adulthood shall tell where you stood in your youth.
            Build both for time and eternity.
            Every privilege comes with the responsibility
            To make the most of it and act in harmony to it’s intended purpose
            Amongst all privilege, life is the greatest of them all
            But it’s yours to choose how much you make of it.
            Early showers are always followed by pretty flowers
            Master the pattern thus you’ll gain stability and progress
            Otherwise, you will be tossed up and down by all the tensions
            and confusion from a world of ever ever-shifting values.
            Men will like you for what you give, but only temporarily
            But celebrate you for who you are
            Charms withers but not characters. Build for time and eternity.

            
            HYMN INSPIRATIONS

            1. An All-Time Prayer
            God, Who Stretched the Spangled Heavens
            Catherine Cameron
            (1967)
                1. God, who stretched the spangled heavens
                Infinite in time and place,
                Flung the suns in burning radiance
                Through the silent fields of space;
                We, Your children in Your likeness,
                Share inventive powers with You;
                Great Creator, still creating,
                Show us what we yet may do.

                2. We have ventured worlds undreamed of
                Since the childhood of our race;
                Knowing the ecstasy of winging
                Through untraveled realms of space,
                Probed the secrets of the atom,
                Yielding unimagined power,
                Facing us with life’s destruction
                Or our most triumphant hour.
                
                3. As each far horizon beckons,
                May it challenge us anew:
                Children of creative purpose,
                Serving others, honoring You.
                May our dreams prove rich with promise;
                Each endeavor well begun;
                Great Creator, give us guidance
                Till our goals and Yours are one.
            2. The Bigger Prayer
            At First I Asked For Light
            Mrs. Ednah Dow Cheney
                1. At first I prayed for light:
                Could I but see the way,
                How gladly, swiftly would I walk
                To everlasting day!
                2. And next I prayed for strength:
                That I might tread the road
                With firm, unfaltering feet and win
                The heaven's serene abode.
                3. And then I asked for faith:
                Could I but trust my God,
                I'd live unfolded in His peace,
                Tho' foes were all abroad.
                4. But now I pray for love:
                Deep love to God and man;
                A living love that will not fail,
                However dark His plan.
                5. And light and strength and faith
                Are opening everywhere!
                God waited patiently until
                I prayed the larger pray'r.

            3. The Morning Prayer
            My Father, From Another Night.
                Henry Williams Baker
                1. My Father, for another night
                of quiet sleep and rest,
                for all the joy of morning light,
                thy holy name be blest.
                2. Now with the new-born day I give
                myself anew to thee,
                that as thou will I may live,
                and what thou will be.
                3. Whate'er I do, things great or small,
                whate'er I speak or frame,
                thy glory may I seek in all,
                do all in Jesus' name.
                4. My Father, for his sake, I pray,
                thy child accept and bless;
                and lead me by thy grace to-day
                in paths of righteousness
                
            4. The Night Prayer
            Lord Keep Us Safe This Night.
            John Leland
            (1754-1841)
                1. Lord, keep us safe this night,
                Secure from all our fears;
                May angels guard us while we sleep,
                Till morning light appears.
                2. Then, with the return of day,
                When we our path pursue,
                Be Thou our Counsellor and Guide
                In all we say and do.
                3. And when our work is o’er,
                And all our sorrows past,
                Lord, grant that we, now gathered here
                May see Thy face at last.

            5. A Tough Time Prayer
            Dear Lord and Father of Mankind
            John Greenleaf Whittier
            (1872)
                1.
                Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
                Forgive our foolish ways;
                Reclothe us in our rightful mind,
                In purer lives thy service find,
                In deeper reverence, praise.
                2. In simple trust like theirs who heard
                Beside the Syrian sea your gracious calling,
                Let us, like them, without a word
                Rise up and follow thee.
                3. O Sabbath rest by Galilee,
                O calm of hills above,
                Where Jesus knelt to share with thee
                The silence of eternity,
                Interpreted by love!
                4. Drop thy still dews of quietness, till all our strivings cease;
                Take from our souls the strain and stress,
                And let our ordered lives confess
                The beauty of thy peace.
                5. Breathe, Breathe, Lord breathe through the heats of our desire
                Thy coolness and thy balm; Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
                Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
                O thou still, small voice of calm!
                
            6. A prayer of Consent
            O Thou Who Camest From Above
            Charles Wesley
            (1762)
                1. O thou who camest from above
                the fire celestial to impart,
                kindle a flame of sacred love
                on the mean altar of my heart!
                2. There let it for thy glory burn
                with inextinguishable blaze,
                and trembling to its source return
                in humble prayer and fervent praise.
                3. Jesus, confirm my heart's desire
                to work, and speak, and think for thee;
                still let me guard the holy fire,
                and still stir up the gift in me.
                4. Ready for all thy perfect will,
                my acts of faith and love repeat;
                till death thy endless mercies seal,
                and make the sacrifice complete.
            7. Equip Me
            Charles Wesley
                1. EQUIP me for all battles and teach my hands to fight ;
                My simple, upright heart prepare, and guide my words aright.
                2. Control every thought; my sin remove in whole ;
                Let all my works be wrought in thee;
                Be wrought in love; in love for thee and men.
                3. O arm me with the meek mind, that was in thee !
                And let my zeal be joined with perfect charity.
                4. With calm and tempered zeal, Let me enforce thy call,
                And vindicate thy gracious will, which offers life to all.
                5. O may I learn the art of reproving with meekness!
                To hate the sin with all my heart, but still love the sinner.
                
            8. May The Lord Depend On You
            William C. Martin
            (1864-1914)
                1.
                In the warfare that is raging for the truth and for the right,
                In this conflict, fiercely warring against the powers of the night,
                God needs men brave and true: My lad, may He depend on you?
                Refrain:
                My lad, may the Lord depend on you, Loyalty is but His due;
                Say x2, Say O spirit brave and true, that the Lord can depend on me!
                2. Though they come on sable pinions, strong in Satanic might,—
                Powers, and dark dominions, From the regions of the night;
                Still God needs men brave and true: May He depend on you?
                3. From His throne He sees us; and helps us to prevail;
                Our leader true is Jesus Christ, we cannot and shall not fail,
                Victory and success crowns the brave and true,—
                But can the Lord depend on you?
            
            QUESTIONS OF LIFE
            1. The Love Question
            From birth till death and without surrender, we’ll protect our loved ones. Protect them from the horrid
            paws of thorny experiences, and if possible to evade the interruptive forces of inevitable causes such as
            death and disease and only give them into new environments such as school and marriage when the
            transition is proven is safe and secure. This we do for the sake of love. Not love for ourselves, but for
            those dear and near to our hearts.
            But the Omnipotent God, from Bethlehem’s birth till Calvary’s death, willingly gave up His beloved into
            this hostile arena of thorns and thistles…With spineless followers who’d forsake him and a cruel soldier
            who’d turn his back into raw meat, betrayal was sure and death was guaranteed.
            And while his raptured spirit and broken body agonized with excruciating pain and bloody sweats, neither
            God nor Him attempted to escape the horrid paws of redemption nor evade the interruptive force of an
            evitable cross. Instead, both responded in nothing but silent endurance and wrapped in darkness. This He
            did for the sake of love, not love for Himself but love for us; we, the spineless but cruel followers and
            soldiers of the cross; dear and near to God’s heart.
            This is the irony barely understood, how we passionately protect our own yet loosely regard Him who
            protects us with such passionate intensity as His own. We marvel that for our own good, God gives the
            best of His gifts to us yet for His glory, we refuse to give up things both perforate and worst.
            How can we want to be ultimately loved yet dare not give even a fraction of love in return? How selfish
            and cold can we be towards Him whose love is selfless and warm, all for love’s sake? Not love for neither
            man nor God. But love for self; ourselves.
            Love is the melody of all hearts. To love; we all know and to count its cost is inevitable. To be loved is
            the pursuit and desire of all beings both human and divine. Thus it’s not a question of how much will
            sacrifice upon the altar of love rather it is a question of to whom and for what will you give up your all so
            as to protect or obtain? In other words, who is our beloved? God or sin? Service or ego? Right or wrong?
            Humanity or self?
            To whom and for what will you give up your all to protect or obtain? This is the first question of life. And
            I hope your answer is right both for your good and for the good of generations to come.
